This folder contains my working code as of 10th Feb 2021.
The files in this folder use the Hough Transform to detect straight lines in images. Clustering is used to identify unique lines.
Parameters are set to be self-regulating in the code. Configurations for each set up (to produce reproducible results with the code) are in the config.py file.
